Super resolution using CNN in Keras based on paper titled ["Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution" (Johnson et al., 2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08155). Dataset used is 10000 images from ImageNet dataset. The training dataset consists of 10000 pairs of low resolution images (72x72x3) and high resolution images (288x288x3). Below are comparison of upscaling between cubic interpolation and learning-based super resolution. [Github](https://github.com/rrwiyatn/deep-learning/tree/master/super_resolution)<br/>
