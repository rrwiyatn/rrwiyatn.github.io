Autonomous drone tracking using GOTURN [(Held et al., 2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.01802) and [SiamFC (Bertinetto et al., 2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.09549). The template image for the tracker was obtained by first running [SSD (Liu et al., 2015)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325). The bounding box was then processed using exponential filter. The drone autonomously follows the target using PID controller. **Watch the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSCGFm3M71A).**
