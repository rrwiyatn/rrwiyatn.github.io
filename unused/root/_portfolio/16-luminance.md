I designed a portable testing device because I want to be able to test various light sensors with direct sunlight and analyze the data back in the lab. So, the idea is to design a device that is able to measure luminance using various sensors, record and save the measurement for further analysis. It also has to be fast/real time (must be as fast as the sensors' response), and portable. In a nutshell: it measures luminance using up to 4 light sensors, records and saves all the measurement into the SD card in .csv format, each file can record up to 70 minutes, it shows the measurement on the LCD screen with a push of a button, it has adjustable LCD contrast, it is programmable using Arduino/C/C++, it can be powered either using 9V battery, or can also be connected it to our laptop using USB B cable, it measures and logs the data every 18ms. **Watch the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_o2Cb7SkTU).**
