**Category**: Course Project<br/><br/>
This project was my first robotics project ever! It is an autonomous forklift robot that could scan an open area to locate, lift, and sort an object to be placed on a certain level of a rack. The robot was built from scratch by using LegoNXT. Building this robot made me realize how autonomous robots could really help us in doing our jobs, especially the dangerous ones. This project was done in a group of three. **Watch the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Zzwe6TNPY).**
