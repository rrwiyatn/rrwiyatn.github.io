Successfully generated adversarial eyeglass that can be printed and worn to fool a face recognition model. The eyeglass was generated using the [Expectation over Transformation (EOT) (Athalye et al., 2018)](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/athalye18b.html) to increase its robustness to small rotation and translation. The implementation was done using Keras and TensorFlow. This was inspired by the work from [Sharif et al. (2016)](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2978392).<br/>
