This board is the electronics of the [Trident](https://www.sofarocean.com/products/trident)'s external payload. The idea is to design a  microcontroller board that can be controlled over WiFi. The image above shows the board that I designed using ESP8266 WiFi module. The board is powered using 3x Li-Ion 18650 batteries, and have the battery protection circuit. The user will have access to all the GPIOs, as well as I2C, I2S, SPI, ADC, 5V, 3V3, and VBAT.<br/>
