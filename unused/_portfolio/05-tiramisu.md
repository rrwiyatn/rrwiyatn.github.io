Image Segmentation using CNN based on paper titled ["The One Hundred Layers Tiramisu: Fully Convolutional DenseNets for Semantic Segmentation" (Jegou et al., 2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09326) in Kerasâ€‹ ([Github](https://github.com/rrwiyatn/deep-learning/tree/master/tiramisu_segmentation)). I also experimented with [Cascaded Refinement Network (Chen and Koltun, 2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.09405) for segmentation though the results are not impressive ([Github](https://github.com/rrwiyatn/deep-learning/tree/master/CRN_segmentation)). CamVid dataset was used for these experiments.<br/>
