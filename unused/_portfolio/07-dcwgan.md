[Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (Radford et al., 2015)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434) and [Wasserstein GAN (Arjovsky et al., 2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875) implementations. The implementation was done in Keras (DCGAN and WGAN). Images above show the generated MNIST, discriminator and generator losses plot can be found in the [Github](https://github.com/rrwiyatn/deep-learning/tree/master/dcgan) repositories.<br/>
