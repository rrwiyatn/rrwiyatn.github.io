I am currently an M.Sc. candidate in Computer Science at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/)/[University of Montreal](https://www.umontreal.ca/) under supervision of [Prof. Liam Paull](https://liampaull.ca/) & Research Intern at [Element AI](https://www.elementai.com/) under supervision of [Dr. Anqi Xu](https://anqixu.me/). I did my B.ASc. in Mechatronics Engineering at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/). During my undergrad days, I was lucky to have the opportunity to start my research journey with [Prof. Jeff Orchard](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jorchard/uw/). I was also fortunate to have interned at [Element AI](https://www.elementai.com/), Canon Innovation Lab, [OpenROV (now Sofar Ocean)](https://www.sofarocean.com/), [Flex (previously Flextronics)](https://flex.com/), [Kiewit](https://www.kiewit.ca/en/), and [Pratt & Whitney Canada](https://www.pwc.ca/en/)

My current research focus is to develop learning framework for solving semantic visual navigation task. Previous to this, I spent considerable time researching the topic of adversarial attacks and defenses, where I published [PAT (ICCV'19)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11042), [MJSMA (MAIS'18)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.07945), and a [review paper (pre-print)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05268).

In general, I love working on various aspects on building robots, whether it is hardware or software - whatever makes a great robot great. I also enjoy presenting my work, so please feel free to let me know if you want to learn more about it!
