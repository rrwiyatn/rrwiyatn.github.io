Photographic image synthesis from segmentation map based on paper titled "Photographic Image Synthesis with Cascaded Refinement Networks" (Chen and Koltun, 2017) in Keras (Github). Dataset used was CamVid dataset. I did not synthesize the diverse collection as explained in section 3.4 in the paper and I also only used 7 refinement modules rather than 9.â€‹<br/>
