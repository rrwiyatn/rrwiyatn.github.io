Photographic image synthesis from segmentation map based on paper titled ["Photographic Image Synthesis with Cascaded Refinement Networks" (Chen and Koltun, 2017)]((https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.09405)) in Keras ([Github](https://github.com/rrwiyatn/deep-learning/tree/master/photo_image_synthesis_CRN)). Dataset used was CamVid dataset. I did not synthesize the diverse collection as explained in section 3.4 in the paper and I also only used 7 refinement modules rather than 9.â€‹<br/>
