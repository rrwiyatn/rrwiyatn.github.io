Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (Radford et al., 2015) and Wasserstein GAN (Arjovsky et al., 2017) implementations. The implementation was done in Keras (DCGAN and WGAN). Images above show the generated MNIST, discriminator and generator losses plot can be found in the Github repositories.
