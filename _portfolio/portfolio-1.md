Inspeksi is an intelligent manufacturing inspection robot that can inspect defects on manufactured parts automatically. There is a 4 DoF arm with camera attached at the end-effector hanging at the top panel inside an enclosure, allowing the arm to inspect the part from multiple view points. The pictures are then processed using Mask R-CNN (He et al., 2017) to classify and localize the defects.
