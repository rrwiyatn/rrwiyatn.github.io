I tried several approaches, including algorithms based on a research paper titled ["Single Image Haze Removal Using Dark Channel Prior" (He at al., 2009)](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2521310) and super resolution like network using perceptual losses trained on NYU dehazing dataset. The algorithm successfully removes haze/fog from an image. Below are before and after images. [Github](https://github.com/rrwiyatn/Image-Dehazing-Dark-Channel-Prior)<br/>
