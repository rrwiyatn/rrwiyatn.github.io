Photo enhancement using perceptual losses, very similar with super resolution network from the paper ["Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution" (Johnson et al., 2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08155). The dataset used for this experiment was the MIT-Adobe FiveK dataset. This is just an experiment to see if the network can be used for this application. Below are before and after images.
