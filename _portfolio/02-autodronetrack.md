Autonomous drone tracking using GOTURN (Held et al., 2016) and SiamFC (Bertinetto et al., 2016). The template image for the tracker was obtained by first running SSD (Liu et al., 2015). The bounding box was then processed using exponential filter. The drone autonomously follows the target using PID controller.
