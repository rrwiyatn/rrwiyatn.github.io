Style transfer using convolutional neural network in Keras based on paper titled ["A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style"(Gatys et al., 2015)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576). Love this paper, this was actually one of the papers that really got me into deep learning! [Github](https://github.com/rrwiyatn/deep-learning/tree/master/style_transfer)<br/>
