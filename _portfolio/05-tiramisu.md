Image Segmentation using CNN based on paper titled "The One Hundred Layers Tiramisu: Fully Convolutional DenseNets for Semantic Segmentation" (Jegou et al., 2016) in Kerasâ€‹ (Github). I also experimented with Cascaded Refinement Network (Chen and Koltun, 2017) for segmentation though the results are not impressive (Github). CamVid dataset was used for these experiments.<br/>
