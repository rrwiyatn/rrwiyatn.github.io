Successfully generated adversarial eyeglass that can be printed and worn to fool a face recognition model. The eyeglass was generated using the Expectation over Transformation (EOT) (Athalye et al., 2018) to increase its robustness to small rotation and translation. The implementation was done using Keras and TensorFlow.
