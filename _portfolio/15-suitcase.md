It is a suitcase robot that follows its owner by using camera. The idea actually came when I helped my friend moved out from her apartment - there were so many stuffs to carry!â€‹ This robot was built from scratch. I built it by applying image processing techniques that I learned during my work term at Flex. **Watch the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EOWeNAi_7I).** [Github](https://github.com/rrwiyatn/Suitcase_Robot)
