It is a suitcase robot that follows its owner by using camera. The idea actually came when I helped my friend moved out from her apartment - there were so many stuffs to carry!â€‹ This robot was built from scratch. I built it by applying image processing techniques that I learned during my work term at Flex. (Github)
