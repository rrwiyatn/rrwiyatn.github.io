I was working on this project but then I realized something very similar called [Adversarial Transformation Network (ATN) (Baluja and Fischer., 2017)]((https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/view/16529)) was already submitted. This is essentially a generative model that generates adversarial examples to fool a trained neural network classifier ([Github](https://github.com/rrwiyatn/deep-learning/tree/master/adversarial_transformation_networks)). I did not write the reranking function in my implementation.<br/>
